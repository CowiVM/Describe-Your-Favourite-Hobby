			I love my books. Whenever I have a holiday, I pick up any book from the shelf and read it. I get so engrossed in the book that I forget to keep track of time!
			<br>
			<br>
			I often borrow books from my friends and my school library. Books hold a great charm for me. Some of my friends enjoy reading a book as much as I do.
			You know why the top students of your class are clever; it is because they have the habit of reading their textbooks. I think teachers teach to grow interested in a subject and give basic ideas about any subject.
			<br>
			<br>
			But it is the reading which brings perfection about the subject of concern. I think reading increases the intelligence level of the child by reading the great book and this practice pushes the whole world towards new discovery, innovation, and creativity.
			<br>
			<br>
			I achieved a lot of knowledge by reading various books and newspapers. I usually read the famous magazine for children, "The Children's Post", because it has content which interests children...It also has puzzles and quizzes which makes it super-fun and super-interesting to read.
			<br>
			<br>
			Most of my relatives and friends know that the best birthday gift that they can give me is books and with their generosity I have over a hundred books in my personal library now.
			<br>
			<br>
			You should usually read a book which inspires you and a book which gives you a chance to select the best path of life. There are love stories, failure stories, religious books, successful personâ€™s books, history books etc.

		<br>
		<p>I like these series because both concentrate on fantasy and fiction. I had read both of these series when I was 9 years old and had a wonderful experience. I would recommend you to read them if you like the genres fantasy and fiction. </p>

		I am now going to tell you about my first series that I read, The Inheritance Cycle. It is an interesting series including fantasy like Elves, Dragons and their Riders, Magicians, Dwarves and long horned creatures called Urgals. I love the series and am reading it for the fifth time now and am still mesmerized as if I am reading it for the first time.
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		Now for the Harry Potter series. It contains magic and all but the main part is the mystery and you will not understand the next part if you do not understand the first. It confusing and it filled with probablities and real-life problems that might occur to you if you knew how to use magic in the Hogwartian format. I will read it for the fifth time now after completing the inheritance cycle which I am currently reading
